This is a document for directions on what I did to get the module working. 
1. open up the kornshell terminals, your gonna need 4
2. first terminal start up the race track using the command 
    ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_autorace_2020.launch.py
3. second terminal start up a ros_shell and start the command
    3.1. make sure to do this in a ros_shell
    3.2. run "act yolo"
    3.3. run "addpypath yolo"
    3.4. ros2 run autonomous_driving sign_detector \--weights_dir ~/av/hyunjoey_av/AV_Project_22/runs/detect/train8/weights \
    This is going to open up a big window if its too big you can minimize it just helps to visualize
    what the robot is seeing
4. finally, in the third terminal run the launch file with the command 
    ros2 launch autonomous_driving autonomous_driving_launch.py
    This will use the launch file and open everything and the robot will start to move. It will also 
    output the state it is in.
