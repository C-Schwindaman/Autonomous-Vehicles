No, the second image performed significantly worse than the first image. 
While the first image could correctly, point out several tail lights. 
The second image failed to even identify one of the two tail lights in the picture and incorretly detected a traffic sign and flag, giving false positives. 
This could be caused by the different angle and lighting taken from the second image.
